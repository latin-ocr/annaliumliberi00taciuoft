THE SYNTAX ANB STYLE OF TACJTUS. 15

complete idea in themselves, or which express an inclination or
effort 3 or such as denote an influence over others and take an
accus. or dat. Tacitus appears to stand alone in using it with
ambio 2. 43, 3 ; compono 3. 40, 3 (ἅπ. εῖρ.); inlicio 2. 37, 2 ; and
some others ; with other verbs he appears to be first to use it in
prose, as with adigo 4. 29, 3 ; arceo 3. 72, 2 ; and several others.

28 [44]. The aecus. with infin. (R. 1351) is used by Tacitus
alone with adnecto 4. 28, 2 ; illacrymo 2. 71, 43 incuso 3. 38, 4
(all ἅπ. εἷρ.). He follows Livy in using it freely with negative
expressions of doubt, as in 2. 26, 23 36, 2, διε. For other re-
markable uses of this construction, see notes on 1. 69, 1 3 72, 2 ;

79, 3 ; ²· 332 5·

29 [45]. The (so-eaned) nominative with infin. (R. 1353) ⁸

is often used where the impersonal construction would be usual
in Classical prose ; as with dubitor 3. 8, 4 ; intellegor 1. 61, 3 ;
and generally with verbs of accusing3 as accusor 4. 22, 43
arguor 2. 50, 33 convincor 4. 31, 5 ; deferor 2. 27, 1.

30 [46]. 'I'he historie infin. (R. 1359) is used by Tacitus
alone with temporal particles in the first clause of a protasis
(always with a finite verb dependent on the same particle fol-
lowing) 3 as with ubi 2. 4, 4 ; postquam 3. 26, 3. His other uses
of the mood in temporal clauses (as in 2. 31, 1 3 40, Ι ; 4. 50, 6)
are not altogether without precedent ; and his use of it in place
of the principal verb, though frequent (e. g. six times in 1. 16),
is surpassed by Sallust.

31 [47]. 'I'he epexegetie infin. (R. 1360, 1361), a Graecism
frequent in poets‚ is used by Tacitus with several adjectives; as
certus 4 57, 1 ; manifestus 2. 57, 43 properus 4. 52, 2.

B. Indz’calive.

32 [50]. 'I'he rhetorical use of this mood for the subjunet.
in the apodosis of conditional sentences is remarkable in Tacitus
sor its frequency, especially in the imperfect, either to express
what might or should have been, in contrast to what is (R.
1535 c); as indignum erat 1. 42, 5 ; or, much oftener, to express
vividly what was on the point of happening (R. 1574, 4); the
apodosis being almost invariably introduced by ‘ni 3’ as ferrum
