6 INTRODUCTJOM

A third picture, equally vivid and distinct, is that of Cer-
manicus ; who is set forth to us as loyal‚ even to the verge of
death, before mutineers who at a word would have proclaimed
lgm emperor² ς as the true avenger of Varus ², prevented‚ as we
are assured, only by a jealous recall from completing the con-
quest of Germany³; as the idol of the people of Rome for his
supposed popular sympathies 4; and as the victim of jealousy
and intrigue, if not of deeper crimes 5.

Other and less prominent characters, such as the hasty and
passionate but not ungenerous Drusus Β, the fiery and ungovern-
able but high—principled Agrippina ⁷, and many others of lesser
note, come in sor their due share of attention, and help to
heighten the contrast to the sinister qualities of the principal
figure.

It is too great a question to be here discussed fully, how much
of this elaborate portraiture is to be taken as historical truth.
Much may be put down as due to the inventions or distortions
of previous writers, only reduced by Tacitus to dimensions
which seemed to him reasonable, by setting aside palpable
falsifications; much to his own fondness for subtle interpreta-
tion and artistic contrast ; much to the satiric tendencies cha-
racterising the literature of the age.

Especially in regard to the representation of the prince, it is
easy to see that Tacitus had imbibed, perhaps unconsciously‚
special prejudices against the early Caesars, and particularly
against Tiberius. His general admiration for the rule of the
Roman aristocracy in its best days had blinded his eyes to its
subsequent decrepitude, and made him view the Republican con-
stitution rather as overthrown by ambitious schemers than as
having fallen a prey to thern through its own inherent weakness“;
while Tiberius, who is, not unjustly‚ regarded as the first syste-
matic encourager of professional informers, is tacitly held re-
sponsible for all the crop of evil traceable to this cause, which
had yielded so abundant a harvest under Domitian³; and
