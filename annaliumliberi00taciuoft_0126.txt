TACJTCS: ANA’ALS.

l. 23. ad duriora, ‘to stemer courses:' ep. ‘dura virtus,’ G. 31, 5.

l. 24. c. 55. decernitur triumphus. This could only be sor the
insignificant campaign of last year (cc. 49-51). The actual triumph took
place two years later (2. 41, 2).

l. 26. repentino . . . excursu, contrasted with ‘summa ope,’ as is
‘initio veris’ with ‘in aestatem.’ The Chatti lived in the present Hesse
Cassel.

l. 27. praecepit, ‘anticipatedz' cp. ². 35, 23 3. 57, Ι.

dissidere in, ‘ were forming factions of.' Such a construction ap-
pears analogous to that sometimes found with verbs of distribution : cp.
2. 8, 1 3 67, 4; also ‘ socios partitur in omnes‚' Verg. Aen. 1. 194.

1. 28. Arminium, a Latin form of ‘ Hermann.’. The character and
career of this prince are summed up in 2. 88, and other relatives of his
are mentioned in c, 57, 5; 58, 9; 60, 1; 2. 9, 2. His leadership of
the Cheruscans and other German tribes began with the rising against
Varus3 at which time he was but twenty-five years old (2. 88, 4), but
had already served with the Roman armies (2. 10, 3), and, according
to Velleius, had received the Roman citizenship and even equestrian
rank.

Segestem. His son is mentioned in c. 57, 2, a brother and nephew
in c. 71, 1.

perfidia . . . aut fide, ¹ the one for treachery, the other for fidelity:'
cp. the similar use of ‘ aut' in 2. 46, 33 3. 63, 6, etc.

l. 3 3. erimina et innoxios =‘ noxios et innoxios.' Such a variation
of the expression is analogous to those noted in Introd. p. 20, ξ 54, and
its harshness here is somewhat mitigated by the frequent use in Tacitus
of abstract for concrete (Id. p. 9, § 1).

P. 73, l. 1. fato, by blindness which must have been ordained by destiny.

l. 4. gener invisus inimici soceri. The two last words are best
taken as genit. sing, and explained by distinguishing ‘invisus' from
‘inimici;’ the meaning being that Arminius, already at enmity with
Segestes on public grounds, was additionally hateful to him from the
way in which he became his son-in-law. This is expanded in the next
sentence (‘quaeque . . . erant’), where ‘ apud infensos' answers to ‘ inimici‚'
and ‘ incitamenta irarum’ to ‘ invisus.'

1. 9. c. 56. Caecinae. He was to hold in check the Cherusci, etc.

( 1. 11‘.) Tauno, the high tract between Wiesbaden and Homburg.
The fort of Drusus appears to have been close to the Rhine.
1. 12. rapit=‘raptim ducit’ (cp. 4. 25, 2), a sense originating ap-
parently with Vergil (Aen. 7. 725; 10. 178; 308).
munitiones, taken strictly with ‘ viarum,' and loosely (in the sense
os ¹ bridging ¹) with ⁶ fluminum-¹
