4 INTRODUCTION.

and discretion, dignified moderation and reserve, that best
guard a senator of rank unharmed through a time of peril¹‚ in
which not only the defiant on one side, but almost as often the
sycophant on the other, are struck down as the course of events
or even the changing humours of the prince may prompt ².

In history written for such a purpose, the delineation of cha-
racter, and analysis of actions into their motives‚ become the
most important elements 3 and it is plain that Tacitus desired in
this part of his work to print indelibly on the memory of his
readers the portraits of the ruling prince and of the minister
whose rise and fall formed the most striking political events of
the period.

In Tiberius he has given us the picture of one to whom the
best part of a lifetime spent in a position overshadowed by
rivals³ and surrounded by perils had made repression and dis-
guise a second nature 3 who found himself, at the age of fifty-
six, stepping into the position which had been held by a master
genius, with whom all comparison must be to his disadvantage,
and succeeding, as if by inheritance‚ to what was neither in
theory nor as yet in practice a hereditary monarchy⁴. Hence
we are to imagine him as feeling that his only security lay in a
sustained hypocrisy3 the position which he had made up his
mind to grasp must seem forced upon him⁵; the power, when
accepted, must be shared in form with the senate, in whose
name all the most important acts must run⁶; he must watch
beneath his mask every look and word of influential senators,
and bide his tirne to strike down the dangerous⁷; he must seem
to trust Germanicus at the head of his greatest army, yet take
early opportunity of removing him8 to a position seemingly still
more exalted but really far less formidable ⁹ ; and send with him
a subordinate governor who, himself much to be distrustedm,
might both check and be checked by him3 he must always
keep up an army of informers who would strain every trivial act
