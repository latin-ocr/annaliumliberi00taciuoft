ΟΝ ΤΗΕ REIGN OF TIBERIUS.

IF Tacitus had ever fulfilled his intention ¹ of taking the life
and times of Augustus as a special subject, his organization of
the empire at home and abroad would no doubt have been de-
scribed in detail. As it is, a knowledge of these institutions is
presupposed in the reader, though a passing notice is introduced
at times in illustration of some point in the subject of the proper
narrative.

In the constitution solemnly inaugurated by his acceptance of
the title of‘Augustus’ at the beginning of 13.<:. 27, Caesar was

and would convey no idea of his relation to the state. The fact,
however, that Caesar is always spoken of not as ‘ princeps

if an abbreviation of any kind, is rather that of some such an
expression as ‘princeps civitatis,' and was intended to designate
his general position as first citizen of the Republic, which he
