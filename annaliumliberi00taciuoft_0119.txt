be a brachylogical genit. of quality (Introd. p. 14, ξ 22); ‘ the Treveri,
whose fidelity was but that of foreignersl On this Gallie tribe, see 3.
40, 1, etc.

1. 32. socer Drusus, i.e. the thought, or image of him: pregnant
construet. as in c. 39, 8. The relationship expressed is throughout that
of Agrippina.

insigni fecunditate. Besides the three sons already born (see
Introd. p. 32), three children had died in infancy.

1. 33. infans, Gaius Caesar (Caligula) was just two years old. In
speaking of him as born in the camp, Tacitus follows a prevalent but,
apparently, erroneous account; his real birthplace being Antium, For
¹ militari vocabulo,' cp. c. 2 3, 4.

P. 66, 1. 2. vulgi. Officers above the rank of centurion wore
‘ calcei ; ² hence the ‘ caliga’ is so sar characteristic of the lower ranks as
to be called ‘ gregalis habitus ’ (c. 69, 5).

l. 4. orant obsistunt, etc. The construction is again designedly
abrupt: ‘orant’ is explained by ‘rediret maneret;' ‘obsistunt' refers
strictly to ‘pars . . . occursantes,’ and more loosely to ‘plurimi . . .
regressi!

l. 6. reeens, ‘fresh srom‚' i.e. with their influence still strong on him:
cp. ‘recens praetura‚’ 4. 52, 2. The abl. is analogous to that of place
whence (Introd. p. 1 1, ξ 13).

l. 10. c. 42. liberos, rhetorical plural; only one child being present.

l. 13. istud sceleris, quasi—partitive genit.: see Introd. p. 13, ξ 20.

1. 14. pietur, here used in a peculiar sense (‘ may exhaust itself'):
so Propertius (4. 19, 8) says (of Medea> ‘quo tempore matris Ι iram na-
torum caede piavit amor.'

1. 15. inausum intemeratumve. Both words appear first in Vergil.

1. 16. quod nomen, etc. Tacitus appears in this passage to follow
a speech of similar character given by Livy (28. 27) as that of Scipio
Africanus to his mutinous troops,

1. 18. proiecta, ‘trampled under foot,' by the insult offered to the
‘legati’ (c. 39, 6).

hostium quoque ius, ‘rights accorded to enemies,' i. e. ‘laws of
war.’ This and the two following expressions dwell rhetorically on the
same idea, the conjunctions being epexegetical ε ‘sacra ’ means ‘sanctity‚'
as in 2. 65, 43 ‘ fas gentium‚’ ‘the obligation towards (law of) nations'
(cp. ‘fas patriae,' 2. 10, 1).

1. 19. divus 1u1ius, etc. The occasion is generally taken to be that
of the mutiny os the tenth legion near Rome in B.C. 47. By calling
them ‘ Quirites‚’ he implied that they were no longer soldiers.

l. 20. divus Augustus, ete. The allusion is supposed to be to a
mutiny at Brundusium in the winter of Bc. 31-30.
