43 [69]. Many of the words apparently invented by Tacitus
sall under the following heads.

(a) Verbal substantives.

(1) in ‘-t0r,' ‘-sor‚' and ‘-trz'x,·' as adcumulator 3. 30, 23 con-
demnator 4. 66, 13 defector 1. 48, 1 ς, exstimulator 3. 40, 1; reg-
natrix 1. 4, 43 sanctor 3. 26, 6 ; subversor 3. 28, 1.

(2) in ⁶-us' (genit. ‘ -us’) and z’n ‘mentum;' as provisus (only
in abl.) 1. 27, 2; imitamentum 3. 5, 6, &c. The large number
of words of each of these classes used is highly characteristic of
Tacitus, as also the preference, in his choice between forms in
‘-men‘ and ‘—mentum,’ for whichever is the more unusual.

(b) Negative words formed with ‘in 3' as inprosper 3. 24,
23 inreligiose 2. 50, 2 3 inturbidus 3. 52, 1.

(c) Words with the prefix ‘per ’ and. ‘ prae ;' as peramoe-
nus 4. 67, 3; perstimulare 4. 12, 7 3 pervigere 4. 34, 6; prae-
gracilis 4. 57, 3.

(d) Frequentative verbs ; as appellitare 4. 66, 1. A general
tendency to prefer such verbs to the simple forms is noticeable.

Many other new words, not classified‚ are noted where they
occur.

44 [71]. 'I'he following are among the words used by
Tacitus in a sense peculiar to him8elfi advertere (in ali-
quem = to punish) 2. 32, 5; amovere (to banish) 1. 53, 6;
conexus (of relationship) 2. 50, 1; gnarus (= notus) 1. 5, 43
proicere (to defer) 2. 36, 3.

Many of the syntactical usages already mentioned are also to
be noted among the innovations of Tacitus.
