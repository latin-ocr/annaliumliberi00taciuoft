TACJTUS: ANNALS.

1. 16. sternuntur, sc. ‘ homines,’ supplied from ‘agmen'

1. 19. subtracto solo, ‘ out of depth.'

l. 20. vox et mutui hortatus, hendiadys, ‘the voice of mutual en·
couragement.'

l. 22. involvebantur, ‘were enwrapped in the waves: ’ cp. ‘aqua
involvens navemque virumque‚' Verg. Aen. 6. 336.

l. 24. utensilibus, ‘ necessaries! The word is used specially of food
in 2. 60, 5; and, in 3. 52, 3, even of luxuries of diet.

1. 26. illiez‘ apud illos.' ‘Hic' and ⁶ ille' are here referred to the
nearer and more remote objectos thought, irrespeetive of the order of
mention (cp. 2. 82, 7).

usus, ‘ resource,' or ‘ opportunity ι ’ so persons who anticipate con-
demnation by suicide are said ‘uti morte' (6. 48, 5), or ‘ necessitate’
<16. 11, 1).

l. 28. [Visurgin] These troops were marching from the mouth of
the Ems (see c. 63, 5) along the coast of Holland, so that some river in
that locality‚ and not the Visurgis (see 2. 9, 1), must be meant. It is
probable that Tacitus gave no name, and that ‘ Visurgin ’ is the gloss of
some ignorant commentator.

1. 29. submersas, sc. ‘fuisse'

1. 32. c. 71. filium. Strabo gives the name of this son as Sesithacus.

P. 82,1. 3. Galliae Hispaniae. These plurals, like ‘ Germaniae‚’
denote the several provinces, of which there were four in Gaul and three
in Spain.

l. 8. gloria: cp. c. 8, 2; 43, 4, etc.

1. 9. sibique et praelio firmabat. The verb is taken in two senses;
‘he was securing them to himself (i. e. in their attachment to him: cp.
3. 60, 1), and strengthening them for battle.'

1. 10. ο. 72. triumphalia insignia. From the later time of Augus-
tus, and always afterwards, a triumph or ovation was awarded only to
the princeps or his family (see c. 55. 1 ; 3. 11, 1 ; 47, 4); others being
forced to be content with a distinction termed that of ‘triumphalia in-
signia’ 01- ‘ornamenta;' by which fiction they were entitled, without
having triumphed, to be called ‘triumphales’ (3. 30, 4, etc), and to be
distinguished by ‘laureatae statuae' (4. 23, 1) and other marks of such
an honour. On Caecina and Silius, see c. 31, 2, etc.; on Apronius,
c. -6, 1.

1³. 11. nomen patris patriae. This title had been given to Cicero
(Juv. 8. 243), and was formally accepted by Augustus from Β. C. 2.
Tiberius persistently refused it (2. 87, 2), but it is generally borne by
succeeding principes. It is formally regarded as given by popular ac-
clamation ζ· ingestum ¹).

l. 13. in acta sua iurari. The ordinances (‘ acta’) of Augustus were

126 ’
