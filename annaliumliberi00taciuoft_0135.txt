NOTES. BOOKI. CHAPS. 70—74.

maintained by an oath taken by the senate in his lifetime⁷ and were thus
permanently enforced after his death (see 4. 42, 3). Asterwards, this
annual oath, taken on Jan. 1, kept in force the ‘acta’ of the existing
‘princeps‚’ and os most of his predecessors; but the name of Tiberius
was never included in the list of those to be maintained. The accus. and
infin. pass. aster ‘ permittere ' are rarely found.

l. 16. legem maiestatis reduxerat. The whole passage shows that
the law had not really fallen into abeyance3 but from this time forth it
is more systematically enforced than under AugustuS.

l. 20. minuisset, taken by zeugma, in some such sense as ‘laesisset‚'
with ‘exercitum ’ and ¹ plebem.’ ‘ Populi Romani ' suggests the contrast
that the law now protected only the ‘maiestas principis.'

inpune. Tacitus often uses this adv. as predicate, with ‘ esse’ (as
in 2. 52, 9; 3. 28, 2) or ‘haberi ' (as in 3. 70, 3).

1. 22. Cassii Severi: see 4. 21, 5. His banishment probably took
place in ΑΒ. 8 or 12.

1. 24. an iudicia. . . . redderentur, i. e. whether the courts were to
receive such cases, and assign jurors to try them.

1. 27. discordem, etc.: cp. 3. 64, 1 ; 4. 57, 4.

1. ²9· ο. 73. modicis, i.e. not ‘inlustres equites· (see 2. 59, 4).

l. 33. cultores Augusti. We gather that bodies, like ‘ collegia,' of
persons so called were kept up (‘ habebantur ⁹) for the private ‘ cultus'
of Augustus in the greater houses.

P. 83, l. 4. violatum periurio numen: for a similar charge later,
see 3. 66, 2. That men swore by the ‘numen Augusti ' even in his life-
time, appears from Hor. Epp. 2. 1, 16.

l. 5. consulibus. This, as well as all the other trials for state
offences mentioned in these Books, were conducted before the senate
(see Introd. p. 26), of which the consuls were the regular presidentS.

l. 8. ludis, probably those known as a three days' festival held in
the Palatium, and called ¹ ludi Palatini.'

l. 11. perinde . . . quam si, ‘just as if.· This combination is pecu-
liar to Tacitus.

1. 12. deorum iniurias dis curae. Roman law prescribed no
penalties sor perjury, leaving the criminal to the judgment of the of-
{ended deity.

1. 13. e. 74. praetorem. Bithynia was a senatorial province, and its
governor would strictly be styled ‘ proconsul' (see Introd. p. 28); but
‘ praetorem ' may be used to imply that Marcellus was only of praetorian
rank, or as a term for governors in general (cp. 4. 15, 3).

1. 14. quaestor ipsius. The old Roman sentiment held that a
quaestcr was in too intimate a relation with the proconsul to be his
accuser (Cic. Div. in Caec. 11. 18).
