TACITUS: ANNALS.

Nero. At his death in A.D. 35, he is stated (6. 39, 3) to have governed
important provinces for twenty-four years ‘ quod par negotiis neque supra
erat.'

1. 1 1. Moesia, an important Caesarian province, fronting on the Danube,
and comprising the whole of Servia and Bulgaria.

additis Achaia, etc.: see c. 76, 4. Sabinus retained these till the
end of his life; but other govemors of Moesia are mentioned (see 2. 66,
33 3· 39, 1³ 447, 1)-

l. 12. morum, partitive genit. : the sing. ⁴ moris est' is frequently so
used by Cicero, etc.

1. 14. iurisdictionibus, a term for the duties of the governor os a
peaceful province. The senatorial provinces are not here spoken of 3
but many of the Caesarian (see Introd. p. 29) answer to this description.

v causae, etc. He is himself said to have told a story of the mis-
taken kindness of those who drove away the gorged flies from a wounded
man, and thus made room for fresh ones; to signify that, by leaving
men long in a province, he hoped to make them less eager to enrich
themselves.

l. 15. alii, sc. ‘tradunt‚' supplied from ‘ traduntur! With ‘ invidia ⁹
the clause ‘ semel . . . servavisse ’ is to be again supplied; ‘ taedio ¹ and
⁴ invidia ’ being causal ablativeS. '

1. 17. ut callidum, etc„ ‘that his «decision was as irresolute as his
perception was acute.’ He had no difficulty in reading rnen's characters.
but much in determining whether to trust them or n0t; and an absence
of all dangerous qualities, like the temperament of Sabinus (see above),
was hard to find.

l. 21. quibusdam. It is stated in a later Book (6. 27, 2, 3) that L.
Arruntius and Aelius Lamia were thus kept many years in Rome, while
uominally governors of Spain and Syria respectively.

1. 23. e. 81. comitiis, used, as in c. 15, 1, of the elections now held
by the senate. The consuls for the year A.D. 16 would be the first ap-
pointed during this principate; those for ΑΒ. 15 having been designated
before the death of Augustus. With ‘ deinceps‚‘ ‘ illo principe ' is again
supplied ; no allusion being here made to the practice of his successors.

1. 2 5. auctores, ‘ the historians,' whom Tacitus usually follows, On
these, and other sources os his information, see Introd. p. 2.

l. 26. modo . . . aliquando . . . plerumque. Three modes are
here mentioned, in which Tiberius secured the election of his candidates,
while seeming to leave free choice to,the senate: (1) the most usual
(⁶ plerumque ’)‚ by handing in two names only to the consuls, and stating
that no others had given him notice that they would offer themselves,
but that any others might come forward who wished: (2) and (3), by
still more infoxmal recommendation ς sometimes indicating by hints in a
