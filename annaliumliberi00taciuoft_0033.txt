THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS. 25

prerogative of pardon is thus vested in him ¹.

By exercising in some form a ‘ regimen legum et morum,' he
retained to himself the most important powers belonging to the
ancient censorship ², such as the revision of the lists of senators
and knights, and the expulsion of unworthy members of those

Another office, regularly held by the princeps from and after
B. C. 12, was that of ‘ pontifex maximus‚’ whereby he became the

the consulships ⁵, rather as a recognition of the dignity of the

senate, and of the praetors‚ as presiding over and regulating the
‘ iudicia publica! Side by side with them were important new

praetorio' and ‘ praefectus vigilum' were his military and police
vicegerents in Rome, while the ‘ praefectus urbi ' and ‘ praefectus
annonae' must have encroached on some functions of the re-
publican magistrates.

Passing from the magistrates to the senate and the comitia,
we find that one of the first acts of Tiberius was practically to
annihilate the latter body, by transferring the election of magis-

² The censorship itself was allowed to drop after Β. c. 22, and was
very rarely revived by subsequent emperors. ³ See 2. 48, 3.

⁵ Augustus had held this office continuously for several years down
to Β C. ²33 Tiberius held it three times during his principate.
