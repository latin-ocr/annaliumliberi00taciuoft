NOTES. BOOKJ. CHAPS. 31-35·

l. 4. in bonum vertebat, ‘gave a good turn t0‚' i.e. by enlist-
ing such qualities on the side of virtue and in the cause of her hus·
band.

1. 7. e. 34. seque et. The MS. has only ‘seque‚' which Halm
follows many others in altering to ‘ Sequanos.'

proximos, ‘those about him’ (as the legati and his ‘amicorum
cohors '). The word appears so used in 4. 12, 7.

l. 8. in verba eius, i. e. to the oath of allegiance (c. 7, 2), conceived
as prescribed by him.

l. 11. audiri coepere. The use of ‘coepi’ with inf. pass (other
than middle passives such as ⁶ fieri,‘ ⁴ videri,' etc.) is chiefly poetical, but
found in Livy.

l. 15. responsum, sc. ‘est,' ‘they replied that they would hear better
as they were’ (cp. ‘sie quoque,’ 4. 40, 4). This refusal is contrasted
with their reluctant obedience to his next order.

vexilla. The term denotes the ensigns of maniples rather than of
cohorts (see e. 18, 3); but even by bringing these to the front sorne
order would ensue, as soldiers instinctively grouped themselves round
their colours (see e. 38, 4).

l. 17. flexit. The use of this verb of a turn of speech or thought
(cp. 4. 37, 2 ; 41. 2) appears to be Tacitean.

l. 23. c. 35. modestia, ‘subordination ’ (cp. c. 49, 6, ete).

l. 26. indiscretis, ‘ undistinguishable.' These eries are shouted all at
once confusedly.

1. 27. pretia. vacationum: see on c. 17, 6.

1. 28. propriis nominibus, ⁸ specifically‚' as the kinds of their hard
work that were most burdensome.

vallum, fossaS, i. e. the construction of these.
l. 29. materiae lignorum, these are distinguished; the first being
timber for military purposes, the latter firewood.
si qua alia. . . . quaeruntur, ⁴ whatever other tasks are devised.’
l. 30. adversus otium castrorum, ‘to prevent idleness in camp.’
veteranorum: see c, 17, 4.

l. 32· mederetur . . . orabant. The combination of constructions
here with ‘orabant’ is extremely harsh, and it has been thought that
‘mortem 'should be altered to ‘morerentur ' or followed by ‘obirent.'
If the text is sound, it must be supposed that the sentences are intended
to be abrupt and exclamatory, as in c. 41, 2, etc.

1. 33. exercitae: cp. c. 17, 7.

P. 63, l. 2. reposcerent. To demand this of him was in itself
‘faustum omen,' as implying that they held him to be the lawful heir,
which was probably more explicitly asserted. The legaey is that men-
tioned in e. δ, 3.
