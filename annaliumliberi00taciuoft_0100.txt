YACITUS .· ANNALS.

l. 26. Sallustius Crispus is employed again on secret service, 2.
40, 3. For a general account of him and of his character and services, see
3. 30. ‘Particeps secretorum' seems to have a wider reference than
this affair, and to denote his general intimacy, ‘secreta’ being con-
stantly used for ‘privaey,' as in 3. 8, 4; 4. 3, 5; 7, 4, etc.

l. 27. codicillos, osten used of missives from the prince, as well as of
,petitions addressed to him (3. 16, 4; 67, 4, etc.)-

l. 28. ne reus subderetur, ‘lest he should be set up (cp. c. 39, 4:
3. 67, 3; 4. 59, 5) as culprit‘ (made to bear the blame).

iuxta periculoso, ‘as it was equally perilous.' On this use os the
abl. abs. see Introd. p. 12. ξ 19 a. This sense of ‘iuxta’ is adopted
from Sallust and Livy.

1. 31. eam condicionem, etc.‚ ‘it is of the essence of ruling, that
accounts will not come right if audited by any one but the ruler.' The

will not bear investigation.

P. 47, l. 1. c. 7. eque& used of the equestrian order, in 4. 74, 5, etc.
The change here from plural to singular is merely sor variety (see
Introd. p. 21, ς) 54).

l. 2. vultuque composito, ‘ with a studied expression : ’ this verb is
osten used in this sense of word or look, as in 2. 34, 6; 3. 44. 4, etc.

1. 3. ne laeti, sc. ‘essent.' Such an omission is usually only found
when another subjunct. follows (see Introd. p. 14, ξ 25).

l. 4. lacrimas gaudium, etc. On the use os asyndeton in Tacitus,
see Introd. p. 17, ξ 65. Here it points the antithesis, as in ‘ex silentio, ex
voce’ (4. 60, 3); and in the common expression ‘huc illuc’(c. 56, 7,etc.).

1. 5. in verba . . . iuravere. In recognition of the ‘imperium pro-
consulare’ of the princeps. the whole people, and even the provinces
(c. 34, 1), bound themselves to him by a ‘sacramentum’ (cp. c. 8, 5)
similar to that taken of old only by soldiers to their general.

l. 9. vetere republica, sc. ‘existente.‘

see c. 3, 3. ‘Ponere' is only here and in 4. 27, 1 used for ‘proponere,’

Introd. p. 14, ξ 265.
