TA CITUS: ANNALS.

p. 14, ξ 23. The defeat of Varus in ΑΛ). 9 is often alluded to in this
Book (see esp. c. 61».

l. 5. vocabula, ⁴ titles.' All the old magistraeies, except the censor-
ship, continued to exist, but it is implied that they were mere names·

I. 8. rempublicam, used emphatically, as in 4. 19, 3, of a constitu·
tion that could truly be called republican. ‘Vidisset’ is apparently a
potential subjunct.

l. 10. c. 4. aequalitate. The use of this word sor political equality
(ἰσοτιμία) appears to be peculiar to Tacitus: cp. 3. 26, 3 ; 74, 6.

l. 13. aegro et corpore. ⁴ Et ' has here the force of ‘ etiam.'

l. 14. in cassum, ‘ idly‚’ as mere declamation.

l. 16. dominos . . . differebant: ‘ rumores differebant de dominis;'
unless, perhaps, ¹ differre ‘ has the force of ‘ to pull to pieces,' as in Verg.
Aen. 8. 643. etc.

l. 17. experientia. The use of this word in the sense of ‘knowledge
gained by practice ' is almost wholly Vergilian (G. 1. 4, etc.) and
Tacitean (c. 46, 2, etc).

1. 18. moli parem: so ⁴ par negotiis,’ 3. 30, 5, etc„ and ‘molesss of
the weight of empire, c. 11, 2.

maturum anniS, etc. Tiberius was then fifty-six, and had held
important military commands during many years, especially in the sup-
pression os the great Illyrian revolt, A.D. 6-9, and in Germany before
and after the defeat of Varus.

1. 21. regnatne—e, ἄπ. dp„ but one of a common class of new words
in Tacitus (Introd. p. 18, ξ 43) : here used invidiously of the ‘domus
principis? Tiberius, on his father's death, passed, at nine years old,
under the tutelage of his stepfather (B.C. 3 3). He was consul at the age
of twenty-nine, and again at that of thirty-five, and received triumphat
honours on three occasions.

1. 22. ne iis quidem annis, etc. He had lived in retirement at
Rhodes from B.C. 6 to ΑΛ). 2, partly owing to the conduct os his wife
(see c. 5 3, 2), partly to avoid rivalry with Gaius and Lucius. ‘Agere'
has osten the force of ‘ degere,' as in 2. 42, 2 ; 3. 48, 2, etc.

l. 2 5. inpotentia, ‘imperiousness ' (abl. of quality). From denoting
absence of sels—control, the word acquires here the sense os violent as-
sei-tion of self-will. It is used again of Livia in 4. 57, 4: cp. ‘ inpotens:
3· 33, 4, etc·

duobus, Germanicus and Drusus.

l. 26. qui rempublicam, etc. They would be an encumbrance, by
monopolising the chief positions in the state, sor the present, and dis-
tract it, by disputing the succession, in the future. ‘Quandoque’ has
the sense of ‘at some time' in 4. 28, 3.

l. 28. ο. 5. agitantibus, best taken as a concise abl. abs.: see Introd.
