30 INTRODUCTION.

Several states and kingdoms not formally reduced to pro-
vinces, but left semi-independent under native rulers ¹, helped
to strengthen the empire against hostile nations.

The great military force of the empire was massed along its
north—eastern frontier ², formed, roughly speaking, by the Rhine,
Danube, and Euphrates. The eight legions of Germany and the
four of Syria have been already mentioned3 the line of the
Danube was secured by five in Moesia and Pannonia, supported
by two more in Dahnatia; to these are to be added two in
Egypt, one in Africa, and three in Spain, making up the whole
standing force of twenty-five legions. Italy had no other garri-
son than the praetorian and urban cohorts (whose headquarters
were in Rome), and the fleets of Misenum and Ravenna.

The legion, commanded by a legatus³ of senatorial, often
even of praetorian rank 4, consisted of ten cohorts, each sub-
divided into three maniples, each of which contained two cen-
turieS. All its soldier5‚ though recruited sreely from all parts

· of the empire ⁵, were Roman citizens 3 but a large auxiliary or
non-citizen force was always attached to it, supplementing it
chiefly with light troops and cavalry: the whole corps being
thus made up to a strength of about 10‚000 of all arms and
descriptions. The main armies may thus be rated in the aggre-
gate at about 2 50,ooo men ; to which perhaps 100,000 may be
added for the troops of Italy, the marines of the fleets‚ and the
detached bodies stationed in peaceful provinces.

This organization as a whole dates from'Augustus, and was
maintained by Tiberius as he found it, without other change of
importance than the transference of the election of magistrates
to the senate ⁶, and the concentration of the praetorian guard in
Rome ⁷.

His general policy was to preserve order and maintain exist-
ing settlements ⁸, and to avoid wars ⁹. Probably from a con-
viction that the conquest of Germany was impracticable‚ he re-
