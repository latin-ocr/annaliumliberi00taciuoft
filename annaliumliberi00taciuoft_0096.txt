TA CITUS ‚⁹ AN.VALS.

1. 1 5. sine ira et studio. Tacitus believes himself able to keep clear of
all rancour or partiality‚ in speaking of princes with whom he had never
come in contact for good or evil.

1. 17. 6. 2. publiea arma, ‘army of the Republie? It is implied that
the forces of the triumviri aud of Sex. Pompeius were mere ‘privata arma.’

1. 18. oppressus, ‘was crushed' (so used of decisive defeat in 3. 41,
3, etc.). The defeat of Sex. Pompeius by Agrippa took place in B.c. 36,
and Lepidus was at the same time ‘stripped of power‚’ Caesar having
induced his whole army to desert him, after which 116 remained in seclu-
sion at Circeii till his death in B.C. 14.

exuto: for the metaphorical uses of this verb, cp. c. 4, 13 59, 73
75, 4; 2. 72, 13 3. 12, 43 4. 72, 1, 616.

1. 19. Iulianis, ‘ Caesarian.’ After the death of the dictator, the
party of the triumvirs, as that of his friends, is still so designate& that
of the senate or ‘ optimates ' being similarly, even after its leader's death,
still called ‘Pompeian’ (c. 10, 1).

1. 20. posito triumviri nomine, etc. The triumvirate lasted tin
the end of B.C. 33. From Bc. 31 to 23, Caesar held a continuous series
of nine consulships (his third to 1115 eleventh). The tribunician power
(see Introd. p. 24), though not assumed as a title 1111 B.C. 23, appears to
have been held by him 111 some form from B.C. 36.

P. 44, 1. 1. annona. i.e. ‘largitionibus annonae,' by distribut-lons of
corn, gratuitously or at low price (cp. 2. 87, 1).

1. 2. munia . . . legum, ‘the functions os law! in other words, the
funetion of virtual legislation through his edicts‚ rescripts, etc.

1. 3. ferocissimi, ‘the boldest spirits;' used 111 a good sense, as is
also ‘ferocia' (c. 12, 6).

per acies. The accus. with ‘per’ has often in Tacitus the force
of a simple abl. or abl. with ‘ ex ' or ‘ in,’ and is often interehanged with
such; see 6. 7, 1ο; 11, 7; 4. 55, 7, etc.

1. 4. servitio, dative, as in c. 48, 3; 4. 46, 4„ etc.

l. 5. opibus et honoribus, abl. z cp. 6. 3, 1 ; ‘tollere honoribusss Hor.
Od. 1. 1, 8.

l. 6. tuta, etc. The stress is laid on the antithesis of ‘ tuta' and
’ periculosa : ‘ ‘ preferred the new iustitutions with their security, to the
old with their perilsss

neque . . . abnuebant. There is much evidence that the provinces
were better off under the new govemment. See Introd. p. 29.
γ 1. 8. certamina potentium. Some civil conflicts, as those of Marius

with Sulla, Pompeius with Caesar, had brought great distress on the “

przvgilcgsmbitu, ‘intrigue ' or ‘solicitation' (cp. 6. 7, 10; 75, 1); often
used for bribery‚ but here distinguished from it (cp. 2. 34, 1).
