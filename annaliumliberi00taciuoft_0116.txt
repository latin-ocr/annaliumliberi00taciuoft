TA CJTUS: ANNALS.

1. 6. potius quam, etc. The construction is an abbreviation sor
‘ potius quam ita victurum, ut,’ etc.

1. 7. deferebat . . . ni: see Introd. p. 16, ξ 32.

l. 9. quidam singuli, in contrast with ‘ conglobata‚’ as ‘ propius in·
cedentes ’ with ‘ extrema pars.’

1. 11. addito, abl. abs.: see Introd. p. 12, ξ 19 a.

1. 14. c. 36. etenim. This introduces considerations which made
the need of remedial measures more pressing.

1. 15. superiorem: see e. 31. 2.

1. 16. oppidum, their chief town. Agrippina, daughter of Ger-
manicus and mother of Nero, was subsequently born there'; and through
her influence the town became ‘Colonia Agrippinensis3’ whence the
modern name, K'oln or Cologne.

1. 17. manus, best taken as ‘ troops;' this meaning being required
by ‘erupturas‚’ and the metaphor being similar to that of H. 3. 15, 4,
‘ Ut civili praeda milites imbuerentur.'

l. 18. gnarus . . . hostis, ‘the fact that the enemy was aware.’
The adj. has here the usage noted with participles in Introd. p. 16,

l. 20. suscipi. The construction still depends on ‘augebat mefflm?

severitas, ‘ rigour‚' apparently in the sense οἱ6 peremptory refusal '
(cp. c. 25, 3), explained by ⁶ seu nihil' below, as ‘largitio ' by ‘sive
omnia concederentur-²

1. 24· missionem, ‘full discharge: ' cp. c. 37, 1 ς 52, 1, etc.

exauctorari. This verb would also naturally imply full release,
but is here qualified by the context, so as to mean discharge from the
ranks of the legion to the condition of a ‘ vexillarius' (c. 17, 4). Similar
qualification attaches to ‘dimissis’ <l.l.), ‘missi' (c. 39, 2), and ‘di-
mitterentur‘ (c. 78, 2). The freedom from camp duties would seem to
have been a new concession, not a standing privilege of the veterans
(cp. ‘eosdem labores‚’ c. 17, 4).

1. 28. c. 37. in tempus: cp. ⁸ ad tempus,’ c. 1, 2.

1. 29. differebatur, ‘was to be deferred! The context shows that
immediate payment was demanded by two legions, and also given to
the other two.

l. 30. non abscessere, i.e. to their winter qnarters at Vetera (c. 45, ι).

1. 31. viatico, used of the private stock or savings of a soldier, as
‘collecta viatica,’ Hor. Epp. 2. 2, 26.

1. 33. civitatem Ubiorum. They were already ‘in finibus Ubiorum '
(c. 31, 3), so that ⁶ civitas ’ here probably means the ‘oppidum' (e. 36, 1).

P. 64, l. 1. de imperatore rapti. These words are emphatic, and
explain ‘turpi agmine,' the deposition os money with the standards
[or safe keeping being not in itself unusual.
