TACITUS: ANNALS.

l. 30. c. 62. sextum post, etc„ a rare form of expression (see Madvig,
276, obs. 6) for ‘ sexto anno post cladem.’

P. 77, l. 4. trahenti, ¹ interpreting; ' so used of action, with ‘ in ' οε
‘ad‚' in 3. 22, 6 ; 4. 64, 1, etc.: cp. ‘varie trahebant,’ c. 76, 6.

l. 5. formidolosiorem. The word appears here alone to take the
construction of ‘ pavidus) etc.‚ and has not often the sense of ‘ timorous.’

1. 6. auguratu et· . . . caerimoniis. The office of ‘augur ’ and its
ritual dated from the early regal peri0d; and the old priestly colleges
had strict rules respecting defilement by contact with the dead.

l. 9. c. 63. eopia, ‘opportunity3' usually with genit„ as c. 58, 6;
2. 7, 2, etc.

evehi, ⁸ to charge;' a military term, as is also apparently ‘ eripi,'
‘ to be carried by a rush.'

l. 15. gnaram: cp. c. 5, 4.

L 17. manibus aequis ‘after indecisive conflict:' a phrase taken
from Sallust and Livy, and here apparently a virtual admission of defeat.

ad Amisiam, i.e. to the mouth of the Ems, where the fleet was
stationed. ,

1. 18. legiones . . . reportat. These words are perhaps interpolated,
and are certainly inaccurate; as, even of the four legions under the
special command of Germanicus (c. 60, 3), two were to make part of
the retreat by land (e. 70, 1).

1. 19. litore, abl. of directim, like ¹ finibus ' (c. 60, 2).

l. 21. pontes longos. Marshes were sometimes bridged by mere
timbers laid. like sleepers‚ along the ground. Here some more perma-
nent, though decayed structure, seems to be described. The locality is
doubtful. but commonly taken to be that of the Bourtanger morass,
south of the estuary of the Ems.

l. 22. L. Domitio: see 4. 44. 3.

1. 25. compendiis viarum, ‘ short routes:' cp. ‘compendia maris,’

1. 28. in loco, ‘where he was;’ i.e. where he had to repair the
bridge: cp. 4. 47, 3.

l. 29. opus et alii praelium. Such an expression is not strictly
identical with ⁸ alii . . . alii,' bnt rather distinguishes the action of the
smaller from that of the larger body. Other writers generally omit the
conjunction, as ‘navibus iunctis . . . alii vadis conati‚’ Caes. B.G. 1. 8, 4.

l. 31. e. 64. nisi. The infin. with ‘nitor’ is rare, but· found in
Sallust, etc.

l. 33. ad gradum, ‘to take stand upon:' so in the phrase ‘ gradu
deicere' (Cic.)

P. 78, 1. 2. sueta, ‘customary.' This participle is rarely, ‘consuetus'
more commonly, used of things in this sense.
