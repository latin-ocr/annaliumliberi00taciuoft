known?

1. 24. erat, ‘it would be:’ cp. Introd. p. 15, 5 3²·

primane, etc. The construction is partly interrogative, partly
exclamatory. .

l. 30. interfici centuriones, etc.: cp. e. 32, 33 35, 1. The ‘legati’
mentioned with the centurions and tribunes are probably the ‘legati
legionum.' Neither these nor the delegates of the senate are stated to
have been ‘ imprisoned ; ' but the whole passage is rhetorical.

1. 31. precariam, ‘on suffe1·ance:’ so ‘ precaria vita,’ H. 4. 76, 5.

l. 33. e. 43. Cur enim, etc. The thought is ‘1 am living on suf-
ferance, and it is the fault of my short-sighted friends that Ι am living at
all! The allusion is to the incidents described in c. 35, 5, 6.

P. 67, 1. 2. melius, sc. ‘ fecit’ (see Introd. p. 14, § 24).

1. 3. tot flagitiorum . . . conscius, ‘ implicated with my army in so
many outrages.' As responsible sor discipline, he treats himself as in-
volved in what he had not prevented.

imaginafion, as also in the apostrophe to Augustus.

cum, ‘going along with‚' i. e. acting upon their heartS.
l. ιο. gloria, ‘pride:’ cp. c. 8, 2, etc.
hanc maculam, explained by ‘iras civiles,’ as ‘eluant' by ‘in

which Halm retains.

1. 14. contactu, ‘contagion τ ’ cp. 4. 49, 4, etc.

dividite. This verb is used by Tacitus (2. 43. 23 3. 15, 3, εἴα),
as by poets (Vei-g. Aen. 3. 38 5, etc.), without prep. or abl. os separation,
in the sense of ‘secernere'

1. 19. excusavit, used here with accus. of the thing deprecated, else-
where with that of the person excused. the aet apologised for, or the
plea alleged. From it, a verb of speaking is supplied with ‘venturum
filium.'

1. 22. legatum legionis. Since the time of Augustus, each legion

this title, instead of being, as formerly, commanded by each tribune in
tum.

l. 2 3. de singulis, ‘ on each severally.' The use of ¹ exercere ’ with
