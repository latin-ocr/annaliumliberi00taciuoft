2. 41, 1 ; 3. 75, 4); (2) between coordinatea' substantz'ves (eg. 4.
5, 1 ; 50, 2); (3) between a substantive and its attribute or de-
pendent genitive (e. g. 3. 10, 4 ; 72, 23 4. 16, 6); (4) between
substantz'ves z'n apposition (e. g. 2. 60, 1 ; 4· 43, 6); (5) aster ‘²²²0
coordinated substantz‘ves (e. g. 1. 60, 5 ; 4. 8, 7; 55, 3). Some os
these uses do not extend to monosyllabic preps.; and some
preps. (e. g. circa, praeter, prope, sine, supra, pro) are never used

by Tacitus in anastrophe3 those mostly so used being ab, ad,
apud, ex, in, and inter.

III. INFLUENCE OF THE STUDY oF BREvrrv.

50 [8o]. Enipses. Many such have been already noted (see
ἕξ 24, 25, 37, 40, 41), as well as many usages adopted for con-
ciseness of expression (§§ 11, 23, 27, 28, 38).

51 [82]. Parenthetioal remarks are often expressed con-
cisely by one or more words equivalent to a relative clause:
such use of rarum is peculiar to Tacitus and to the Annals (1.
39, 7; 56, 2, &c.); other similar expressions are vix credibile

dictu (1. 35, 6); mirum dictu (2. 17, 4), διας see also 5a, and
note on 4. 55, 6.

52 [83]. Zeugma is more common in Tacitus th.an in any
other writer. See the use of redimi 1. 17, 63 probabam 1. 58, 2 ς
permisit 2. 20, 2 3 appellans 2. 45, 4 ; intentarent 3. 36, 2 ; and
very many others. Akin to this is the use of a masc. noun for
persons of both sexeS, as privigni 4. 71, 7.

53 [84]. Pregnant constructione are often adopted for con·
ciseness ; as ius legationis . . . miseratur 1. 39, 8 ; proruunt
fossas 1. 68, 2; permoveor, num 4. 57, 2; also pregnant mean-
ings of words, as of praemia 2. 81, 13 venenum 3. 22, 23 pax 3,
33, 2·

IV. INFLUENCE OF THE STUDY OF VARIETY.

54 [87-91]. It is characteristic of Tacitus constantly to
change the form os expression in corresponding clauses
without other apparent object than that of variation. Among
the more common changes are—

(a) From one prep. to another (ff similar 7nea7tz‘ng‚· as in . . . ad
1. 28, 7; inter . . . apud 3. 40, 1; per. . . in 4. 55, 7.
