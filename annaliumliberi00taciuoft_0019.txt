THE SYNTAX AND STYLE OF TACJTUS. 11

(R. 1146), is used by Tacitus without such restriction, and with-
out any notion of the interest of the agent; as sibi aspici
1.17, 10: see also 2. 50, 4 ; 57, 5 ; 3. 20, 3.

9 [19]. 'Phe poetical dat. where a genit. would be more
usual (R. 1154), rare in prose before Livy, is especially frequent
in Tacitus; as rector iuveni 1. 24, 33 paci firmator 2. 46, 6;
custos saluti 3. 14, 7 ς Seiano fautores 4. 60,’2, and very many
others.

10 [21]. 'I'he dat. after compound verbs, where the accus.
with prep. would be expected, is also poetical ; as pectori adcre-
verat 1. 19, 1 (where see note).

11 [22]. The dat. of the gerundive‚ expressing work con-
templated‚ is extremely characteristic of Tacitus and especially
frequent in the Annals, being used with more than twenty ad-
jectives (see 1. 23, 5; 31, 23 2. 57, 3, &c.)‚ and much oftener
with verbs, often so as to be fully equivalent to a final clause ;
as with deligere 2. 4, 1 ; eximere 3. 22, 63 fingere 4. 1, 4 ; mit-
tere 1. 60, 2. The simple dat. ofa noun is sometimes used with
the force of a final clause 3 as morti deposcit 1. 23, 6 (where see
note).

12 [23]. The dat. expressing that which a thing serves as
or occasions, or predicative dat. (R. 1158), most frequent in (he
case of forms in ‘-ui,’ and especially used with ⁴ esse ' or ‘haberi‚'
is common in Tacitus (see Roby, Pref. xxv-lvi). Among the
more noteworthy instances are those of absolutioni 3. 13, 2;
honori . . . ignominiae 3. 32, 25 noxae 3. 13, 2 ; obtentui 1. 10, ις
ostentui 1. 29, 4.

sense, of common names; as fuga impediverat 1. 39, 63 pro-
