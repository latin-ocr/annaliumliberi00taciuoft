courtiers, ete).

1. 19. loqueretur, subjunet. of cases often occurring: see Introd.
p· 16, ξ 34·

l. 22. dabat et famae, ‘it was his eoncession to public opinion’
Horace has ‘das aliquid famae’ (Sat. 2. 2, 94); and here the object os
the verb is supplied by the clause ‘ ut . . . videretur!

vocatus electusque. It should be remembered that the formal
choice of a princeps by ‘the senate was at this time so far a reality that
there was no precedent of hereditary succession.

1. 23. per uxorium ambitum, etc„ i.e. ‘through the adoption osa
dotard, procured by the intrigue of a woman' (see the statement in 4.
57, 4)-

l. 26. inductam, ‘was put on’ (as a mask): so ‘inducere plumas,’
Hor. A. P. 2.

1. 27. recondebat, ‘he would store in memory.’ This trait in Tiberius
is alluded to in c. 69, 7 ; 4. 21, 2, etc.

l. 28. c. 8. Nihil . . . passus est, i.e. he imposed his tribuniciam veto
on all else. That he was present is shown in ξ 5, 6.

supremis, ‘obsequies' (cp. 4. 44, 6): ostener used of death, as in
3· 49) ¹2 etc·

1. 31. Augustum, adj, as in ‘mensis Augustus,· ete.: so ‘nomen
Sempronium' (c. 53, 85, ‘ Furium’ (2. 52, 7), etc. Henceforth Tacitus
calls her ⁶ Augusta‚' or in full ‘ Iulia Augusta ' (as in 5. 1, 1).

in spem secundam, sc. ‘scripserat,' or perhaps ‘adsumebanturz'
‘spes secunda’ is an eleganceof expression sor ‘heredes secundi,' ‘heirs
in default‚’ should Tiberius and Livia have died before him. The
‘nepotes’ are Germanicus and Drusus, the ‘pronepotes’ the three sons
os the former.

l. 33. sed iaetantia, etc. This was set down to ostentation, as the
existence of so many heirs before them made their position an empty
compliment. The construction is similar to that of ‘ sed quo,' etc. (e. 3,
5), and the ablatives are causal.

P. 48, 1. 1. civilem, that of an ordinary citizen: so ‘civilia,’ c. 12, 6:
‘civile ingenium) c. 33, 5, etc.

populo et plebi. It would appear from Suetonius that 40 million
H.S. was lest ‘populo’ (generally taken to mean the public treasury),
and 3} millions to the tribes, i. e. 100‚ooo H.S. for distribution among
the poorer members of each tribe. There is, however, some reason to
think that the whole sum must have been thus distributed.

l. 3. urbanis quingenos. From a statement to this effect in Sue-
tonius, it is thought that these words must have been omitted in the
MS. of Tacitus. On the praetorian and urban cohorts, see 4. 5, 5.
