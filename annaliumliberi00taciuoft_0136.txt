TACJTUS: ANNALS.

1. 14. postulavit. Tacitus osten uses with this verb the genit. usual
with ‘ accuso‚’ etc. (3. 66, 2; 70, 2, etc).

l. 15. subscribente, ‘ appearing as subordinate accuser.⁹

Romano Hispone. This person is known otherwise as a pro-
fessional rhetorician, and is more likely than Crispinus to be the subject
of the following sentences.

1. 16. audaciae, abst. for coner„ ‘daring deeds.’

l. 18. adrepit. The word is used of those who worm themselves
into a position, and here denotes what we might speak of as ‘getting
the ear of the prince's vindictiveness ’ (cp. 3. 50, 5).

l. 22. sed . . . insimuJabat. Probably ‘insimulabant' should be
read; but, if the text is right, the subject,'n0twithstanding the long
parenthesiS‚ must be ‘Crispinus;' as the charge brought by Hispo is
distinguished below. ‘ Sed' osten marks the return from a digression,
as in 3. 62, 3; 63, 5, etc.

l. 23. inevitabile crimen; in apposition with the sentence: see
Introd. p. 10, ξ 5 a.

1. 24. obiectaretque reo, ‘and charged the accused with mentioning
them.' 1f what he was alleged to have said was known to be true in
fact, all would believe that he had really said it.

l. 28. exarsit, sc. at the slight offered to the divinity of Augustus.
The destruction of any statue was a significant aet: cp. 3. 14, 63 Juv.
10. 58.

l. 29. palam et iuratum. The former word is in contrast to a silent
vote (¹ per discessionem:' cp. 3. 69, 9); the latter implies a solemn
assertion that the vote was given on grave public grounds (see 4. 31, 5).

l. 30. eadem necessitas, that of also voting openly and on oath.

1. 31. Cn. Piso: see c. 13, 3, etc.

P. 84, l. 1. quantoque, etc. With ‘paenitentia patiens‚’ ‘tanto
magis’ is to be supplied (see Introd. p. 17, ξ 40); ‘paenitentia’ is a
causal abl.

tulit, prol ably referring to ‘ laturum sententiam’ above. He gave
the first vote for acquittal.

l. 3. reciperatores. Such a board was merely a civil tribunal to
assess the amount which he was to refund: the more serious criminal
charges being quashed by the vote above given, or dropped.

l. 4. o. 75. iudiciis adsidebat, ‘he would sit as assessor in the law—
courts‚’ besides being constantly present at the trials held before the
senate (‘ patrum cognitiones ') mentioned in the previous chapters *see
on c. 73, 3). In these ordinary courts the praetor (c. 72, 4] presided;
whose curule chair was placed on an elevated tribunal in the apse at
the end of the basilica.

l. 5. muita . . . constituta, ‘ many decisions were established-⁹
