15 [27]. 'I'he free extension of the instrumental abl. to

legionibus petitum 2. 46, 2; corruptoribus tentare 2. 79, 4;
criminatoribus . . . efficiebat 4. 12, 6.

16 [28]. 'I'he abl. of manner is often used boldly without the
addition of an adj. (R. 1236, 1239); as spe vel dolore 1. 59, 1 ;
clamore et impetu 1. 68, 43 ordinibus ac subsidiis 2. 80, 6;
catervis 4. 51, 1.

17 [29]. 'Phe abl. of quality (R. 1232) is often used brachy-
logically of persons without the addition of the verb ‘esse' or os
a common name (see also ξ 22); as artibus egregiis 1. 13, 13

18 [30]. The eausa] abl. is used with especial freedom in the

or of objective causes; as dissensione ordinum 3. 27, 2.

⁹19 [31]. Some uses of the abl. absolute are remarkable for

their conciseness.

(a) The use of tlte nent. abl. osa participle as predicate, with
α sentence as subject, is abundant in the Annals, and elsewhere
comparatively rare. Among the more peculiar instances may
be noted addito 1. 35, 6 ; adiecto 4. 70, 7 ; credito 3. 14, 4 ; in-
tellecto 1. 49, 3 ; pensitato 3. 52, 43 quaesito 2. 9, 1 ; repetito
3. 3 3, 1 : some neut. adjectives are similarly used ; as periculoso
1. 6, 6 ; libero 3. 60, 6.

(b) The abl. os an adj. or part. is thus used by z‘tself without
α demonstrative or relative pronoun, when the subject has been
recently expressed ; as cohibita 3. 33, 1 ; or even when it can be
supplied from the sense ; as orantibus 1. 29, 2.
