NOTES. BOOKI'. CHAPS.3-6.

p. 12, ξ 19 b. Tacitus very often uses the verb in the sense os ‘ agitare
animo‚' e. g. c. 12, 6; 18, 2. etc. -

gravescere valetudo, ‘his sickness becomes more burdensome.'
This verb is elsewhere almost wholly poetical.

l. 29. scelus uxoris. An absurd story is told that she poisoned some
of the figs on a tree, and induced him to pluck and eat thern, while she
ate others from the same tree which were harmless. ‘Suspectare' has
ι this sense in no earlier author (cp. 4. 3, 5).

quippe, suggesting a motive for the alleged crime.
1, 30. incesserat, ‘had spread: ' so used of reports in 2. 5 5, 5, ete.
consciis . . . comite. Those to whom he communicated his plan
are distinct from the one who actually accompanied him.

l. 32. multas . . . lacrimas, sc. ‘ fuisse : ' see Introd. p. 14, ξ 25. The
same tense is repeated below with ‘gnarum id.’

P. 4⁴3, 1. 1. gnarum=‘notum.' The passive use of this word is
common in Tacitus (e. g. c. 51, 4; 63, 3, etc.)‚ and may be called pecu-
liar to him. On the less rare similar use of ‘ignarus‚’ see 2. 13. 1, etc.

l. 2. dubium, etc. On such parenthes-es, see Introd. p. 20, 5 51.

1. 3. quaesita, ‘unnaturall The word is similarly used os what is
studied or far-setehed, as in 2. 53, 43 3. 57, 1, etc. It is implied that
Marcia at least believed that her husband had committed suicide by the
order of Augustus,

l. 4. utcumque, etc. Tacitus dismisses the charge of poisoning and
the tale supporting it without expressing an opinion on either. It is
most improbable that Augustus could have taken such a. voyage with-
out the knowledge of his wife.

1. 7. apud. The use os this prep.⁷ where a simple locative or ‘in'
with the abl. would be usual, is common in the Annals te. g. c. 61, 5;
64, 3 ς 3. 71, 2 ; 4. 64, 4, eto), and comparatively rare in earlier Latin.

1. 8. aeribus, ‘ vigilant: ’ osten used to express diligent performanee‚
as in 2. 43, 3; 3. 48, 2, etc.

1. 13. 0. 6. quamvis firmatus animo, 'notwithstanding his fixed
resolve! The struggle illustrares Agrippa's personal strength, noted in
c· 3, 4·

1. 15. praescripsisset. The subjunet. is used because this is only
the representation of Tiberius.

1. 16. custodiae adposito, ‘set over the guard,' or ‘ set over him for
a guard.’ The similar expression in 2. 68, 3, is in favour of the former
explanation; the latter derives some support from 4. 60, 1.

1. 17. quandoque, not here used as in c. 4, 5 ; but for ‘ quandocum-
que,’ as in 4. 38, 3, etc.; Hor. Od. 4. 2, 34, etc.

1. 20. duravit, ‘hardened himself! In 3. 15, 4 we appear to have
the full expression ‘durat mentem: ’ cp. ⁸ cor dura,‘ Plaut. Pseud. 1. 3, 6.
