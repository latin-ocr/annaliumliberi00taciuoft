26 INTRODUCTJON.

trates to the senate ¹. The people may probably have felt that
the substance of power had long since departed from them, and
that only the shadow had now followed it: at any rate, the
change took place without serious opposition, and the populace
were left with nothing henceforth to care for but their bread and
their amusements ².

With the senate it was outwardly far otherwise. In place of
the ‘ senatus populusque Romanus,' in whose name the acts of
Rome used to run, this august body alone remained, with ap-
parently still more than its ancient majesty. ‘Affairs that con·
cerned the state, and the most important affairs which concerned
individuals ³,' were still handled by it with apparent freedom3
its decrees come to differ only in form from laws ; in choosing
magistrates, who by virtue of such magistracy become senators 4,
it is formally a self-elective body3 in form even the right of
choosing the princeps himself devolves upon it ⁵3 the whole
narrative of Tacitus is full of its debates and decisions„ As of
old, it awards triumphal honours ⁶ and other recognition of vic-
tories ⁷, and sends its thanks or rewards to allied kings as repre-
sentative of the state⁸; it decrees public funerals⁹ and other
honours to the dead¹⁰; it makes regulations to repress disorder¹¹‚
and curb extravagance¹² and immorality¹³‚ and to deal stringently
with the abuses of religious ¹⁴ or superstitious practices ¹⁵3 while,
abroad, all important questions appertaining to the adminis-
tration of its own provinces are referred to it3 one such

occasion, that of the deputation frorn Asia on the right of sanc-
tuary, being described as unusually impressiveffi. Besides all
this, the senate has supplanted the praetor's tribunal as the
great high court of criminal justice ¹⁷, before which culprits of
rank are almost always arraigned‚ especially on the constantly
recurring charge of ‘ maiestas.'
