14 INTRODUCTION.

¹22 [34]. 'I'he genie. of quality is often used with the same
brachylogy as the corresponding abl. (ξ 17); as Lentulus senec-
tutis extremae 4. 29, 1 ; velut eluctantium verborum 4. 31, 4.

23 [37]. ¹I'he gerundive genit. (see the corresponding dat.
ξ 11) is used oftener by Tacitus than by any other author, and
with especial frequency in the Annals ; sometimes with the force
of a genit. of quality3 as bellum abolendae infamiae 1. 3, 63
often, by a more distinctly Tacitean usage, to qualify, not any
expressed noun, but the whole sentence (R. 1288); as Aegyptum
proficiscitur, cognoscendae antiquitatis 2. 59, 1 : so vitandae sus-
picionis 3. 9, 23 ostentandae virtutis 3. 41, 4. This usage is
perhaps a Graecism, from such constructions as τὸ ληστικὸν
καθήρει, τοῦ τὰς προσόδους μᾶλλον ἰέναι αὐτῷ (ThuC. Ι. 4).

111. VERBS.

24 [38]. Tacitus uses more freedom than elassical writers
in the omission of verbs of speaking (as in 1. 9, 4 3 38. 3 ; 41,
2), thinking (as in 2. 5, 3), moving, or acting (as in 1. 43, 1 ; 4.
38, 5), when they can be supplied from the sense or context,
especially in lively descriptions or rhetorical passages.

2 5 [39]. Other parts of the verb ‘ esse’ than the present
indie. or infin. are often omittedg as ‘erat,' ‘erant,' &c.,
especially in relative οι· dependent clauses3 as in cuius manu
1. 7, 95 ubi crematus 2. 83, 33 donec id vetitum 4. 74, 6 (cp. 1.
69, 2 ς 3. 26, 3); also ‘fore,' in 2. 15, 33 and ‘fuisse‚' as in 2.
31, 4 ; 73, 4 ; 3. 16, 1, ἃς. The subjunctive of this verb is also
sreely omitted, when another subjunct. follows, as in 1. 9, 1 ; 35,
1 ; 65, 1, δια, and in oratio obliqua, as in 1. 11, 23 4. 39, 4.

26 [40]. The poetieal use of simple verbs for eompound
is especially abundant in the Annals, where nearly forty verbs
so used are noted. In the first Book alone may be instanced
ardescere 73, 1 ς asperare 72, 5; firmare 71, 5 ; gravescere 5, 1 3
notescere 73, 3 3 piare 42, 2 ; ponere (= proponere) 7, 5 ; solari
