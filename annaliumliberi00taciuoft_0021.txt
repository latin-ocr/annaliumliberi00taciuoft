THE SYNTAX ΛΝΒ STYLE OF TACITUS. 13

D. Genz'lz've.

20 [32]. Partitive οι· quasi-partitive (R. 1296). Δ Such geni-
tives are abundant in Tacitus 3 the partitive meaning being often
lost sight of, and the construction being equivalent‚ as in poetry
(e. g. ‘strata viarum,' &c.)‚ to a simple subst. and adj.

(a) aster neut. sz‘ng.; as umido, lubrico paludum 1. 61, 23
65, 6 ; sometimes even after a case depending on a prep. ; as in
prominenti litoris 1. 53, 7.

(b) after nent. pl„ still more frequently; as cuncta curarum
3. 35, 2 ; tacita suspicionum 4. 41, 1.

(c) aster masc. orfem„ also frequently ; as with pauci, multi,
alii, &c.: also in such expressions as quinque consularium 3. 28,
6; leves cohortium 3. 39, 1.

(d) wz'ffz adverbs; as eo furoris 1. 18, 23 huc adrogantiae
3· 73, 1.

21 [33]. objective genitive (R. 1312).

(a) wz'tlz verbs. It is peculiar to Tacitus to use such a genit.
with monere (1. 67, 1), on the analogy os its compounds, and
with adipisci (3. 55, 1), on the analogy of potiri. He also ex-
tends the usage of an elliptical genit. with verbs of accusing or
judging to new examples3 as postulare 1. 74, 1 ; deferre 4. 42, 3.

(b) with participle& the frequency of such a genit. is cha-
racteristic3 e.g. with cupiens 1. 75, 4; inpatiens 2. 64, 43 in-
tolerans 1. 31, 1 ; retinens 2. 38, 9 ; sciens 1. 64, 6.

(c) willz adjectives, the usage is also characteristic from its
extreme frequency3 the genit. sometimes expressing direct object
(R. 1312), where the accus. with participle might be substituted
(as with pavidus 4. 38, 1 ; providus 4. 38, 1, &c.); or a more
remote object (R. 1318), where the abl. with de would be usual
(as with ambiguus 1. 7, 4 ; certus 1. 27, 3; securus 3. 28, 3) ;
oftenest of all expressing (as in poets) the thing in point of
which a term is applied to a person (R. 1320) : animi is con-
stantly thus used (1. 32, 53 69, 2, &C.); and such a genit. is
found with manifestus 2. 85, 3 ; melior 3. 74, 1 ; modicus 2. 73,
3; occultus 4. 7, 23 pervicax 4. 53, 1; praeclarus 4. 34, 4;
validus 4. 21, 5 3 vetus 1. 20, 2 3 and many others,
