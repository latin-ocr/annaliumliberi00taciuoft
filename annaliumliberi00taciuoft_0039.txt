THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS. 31

called Germanicus as soon as the defeat of Varus seemed suf-
ficiently avenged ¹, and allowed no further aggressive expeditioris
in any quarter.

His domestic administration during the first eight years of
his rule receives the full commendation of the historian, except
in respect of the trials for ‘ maiestas ξ’ a charge which, even in
those years, had been strained beyond the limits necessary to
ensure respect for the government ⁸, and in regard of which a
change still for the worse, as regards frequency of prosecutions
and severity of sentences, is to be noted in the period covered by
the fourth Book 4.

Out of these trials arose the evils of espionage in private life ³
and the officious activity of a large body of professional ac-
cusers ⁶, encouraged by the more or less open support of the
prince, and often gorged with extravagant rewards ⁷.

Hence ensued a general state of panic and suspicion; men of
rank stooped to a servility so abject as to defeat its own object,
and to disgust and irritate him whom they sought to pleasess:
others provoked their fate by outspoken opposition⁵³= few had
the tact to tread a middle path¹⁰z and the great aim of any
public man was not so much to serve the state as to preserve
himself.

Literature shared the fate of politics: history¹¹ and most other
kinds of composition were dangerous to their authors; and the
result is, that hardly any generation appears to be so barren in
intellectual activity as that of the rule of Tiberius ¹².
