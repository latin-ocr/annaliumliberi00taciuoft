TACJTUS: ANNALS.

1. 15. e. 66. obturbavit, apparently ‘ threw down‚’ as in H. 3. 25, 2
(⁴ postquam impulsos sensit . . . denso agmine obturbabat ¹), and some-
times ‘ proturbare.'

1. 17. aversa hosti. The praetorian gate, to which this was oppo-
site, always faced the enemy. ‘Aversus ’ probably takes a dat. in Hor.
Sat. 2. 3, 107 (⁴ aversus mercaturis ').

nleassS.

l. 24. c. 67. principia: see c. 61, 3¹.

1. 2 5. temporis ae necessitatis monet, ‘warns them of the crisis

and urgency.' The simple verb here takes the construction of ‘ad- '

moneo:' cp. 2. 43, 5.

1. 27. expugnandi hostes spe. This inversion sor ‘hostes spe ex-
pugnandi' appears to be no more than an affectation of style.

l. 29. perveniri, rhetorical, ‘ this sally carries you to the Rhine: i. e.
no further difficulty will obstruet your march.

l. 3¹· in castris honesta. Probably their past distinctions are
meant, in contrast to ‘ adversa,' such as the defeat on the previous days
(c. 64, 33 65, 9), or possible disasters yet in store for them. Others
take it to mean their general sense of military honour.

l. 3²- orsus a suis, ⁴ first his own, then those of the legati and tn·-
bunes.' This was to make up sor the loss of horses (c. 65, 5).

P. 80, 1. 1. nulla ambitione, i. e. to the bravest, whoever they

promptam, ‘easy : ' cp. ‘ promptam . . . possessionem‚’ 2. 5, 4.

1. 8. proruunt fossas, a pregnant expression (see Introd. p. 20, ξ 53)
for ⁴ proruunt terram in fossas? The hurdles were also thrown over the
trench. by way of bridgeS.

l. 9. super, adverbial: cp. ‘incensa super villa,' 3. 46, 7.

1. 10. haesere munimentis, probably abl. as in c. 65, 4. meaning
that they were ‘ impeded by (¹ trying to surmount ') the earthworks.'

l. 12. impetu, abl. of manner: cp. c. 59, 1; Introd. p. 12, ᾗ 16.

tergis . . . circumfunduntur, by a sally from the gates.
